Compile lines at the end of the .cpp files
If none (.C files), call them with root because they are pure ROOT macros

- General purpose tools : 

caen2root                   Converts .caendat raw datafile into time-ordered and event-built root file
Tools/caendatInspect        Dumps raw data from .caendat datafile in the terminal
Tools/caendatIntegrityCheck Checks if the raw .caendat datafile is not corrupted

- Special tools (hard-coded variables) :

writeTraces    Writes the traces in TGraphs with CFD
studyCFD       After event-building, checks the time correlations between detectors
